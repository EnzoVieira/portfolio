year: "2023"
description: "At the beginning of 2023 I was invited to teach a UI/UX Workshop at the University of Minho, in Portugal, by a group of Software Engineering students that I am part of. For 2 hours I taught about User Flow, Design System, theoretical content about interface design, UX Design principles and the application of cognitive biases for sales. The project I developed was a fictitious travel agency that aimed to provide unforgettable travel experiences to families and adventurers, without leaving consumers needing to worry about any trip planning."
